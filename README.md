# Assignment 2: Classify

TODO: Add your own descriptions here.

problemA:

task1:Given an array of values, if a value is greater than or equal to 0, keep it as is. If a value is less than 0, change it to 0. Continue this operation until all values in the array have been processed. I once encountered an issue with accessing the address of an array, but later resolved it with GPT's help.

task2:Find the position of the first maximum value in the array. I once encountered an issue with accessing the address of an array, but later resolved it with GPT's help.

task3.1:Perform the dot product operation on two matrices. I once encountered a problem with calculating the dot product, and I solved it using GPT.

task3.2:Perform matrix multiplication on two matrices. I once encountered a loop problem with matrix multiplication, and I solved it using GPT.

problemB:

task1:read a binary matrix from a file and load it into memory. Replace all mul instructions with equivalent operations using only add instructions.

task2:write a matrix to a binary file.Replace all mul instructions with equivalent operations using only add instructions.

task3:bring everything together to classify an input using two weight matrices and the ReLU and ArgMax functions.Replace all mul instructions with equivalent operations using only add instructions.
